# tpcds-kit

The official TPC-DS tools can be found at [tpc.org](http://www.tpc.org/tpc_documents_current_versions/current_specifications.asp).

This version is based on v2.10.0 and has been modified to:

* Allow compilation under macOS (commit [2ec45c5](https://github.com/gregrahn/tpcds-kit/commit/2ec45c5ed97cc860819ee630770231eac738097c))
* Address obvious query template bugs like
  * query22a: [#31](https://github.com/gregrahn/tpcds-kit/issues/31)
  * query77a: [#43](https://github.com/gregrahn/tpcds-kit/issues/43)
* Rename `s_web_returns` column `wret_web_site_id` to `wret_web_page_id` to match specification. See [#22](https://github.com/gregrahn/tpcds-kit/issues/22) & [#42](https://github.com/gregrahn/tpcds-kit/issues/42).

To see all modifications, diff the files in the master branch to the version branch. Eg: `master` vs `v2.10.0`.

## Setup

### Linux

Make sure the required development tools are installed:

Ubuntu:

```

CentOS/RHEL:

## Using the TPC-DS tools

### Data generation

Data generation is done via `dsdgen`.  See `dsdgen --help` for all options.  If you do not run `dsdgen` from the `tools/` directory then you will need to use the option `-DISTRIBUTIONS /.../tpcds-kit/tools/tpcds.idx`.

### Query generation

Query generation is done via `dsqgen`.   See `dsqgen --help` for all options.

The following command can be used to generate all 99 queries in numerical order (`-QUALIFY`) for the 10TB scale factor (`-SCALE`) using the Netezza dialect template (`-DIALECT`) with the output going to `/tmp/query_0.sql` (`-OUTPUT_DIR`).

```
dsqgen \
-DIRECTORY ../query_templates \
-INPUT ../query_templates/templates.lst \
-VERBOSE Y \
-QUALIFY Y \
-SCALE 10000 \
-DIALECT netezza \
-OUTPUT_DIR /tmp
```
