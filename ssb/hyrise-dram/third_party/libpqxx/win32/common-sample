# Common options for Visual C++ makefiles to build libpqxx and its regression
# test.
#
# THE ORIGINAL OF THIS FILE IS CALLED common-sample; DON'T EDIT THE ORIGINAL or
# you may lose your changes when you upgrade your libpqxx sources.
# Instead, copy "common-sample" to "common" and edit just the file "common".

# Caution: on Windows, some environments, such as the "make" that comes with
# Visual C++, expect you to use backslashes as path separators (for example,
# "C:\src\libpqxx") whereas others like MinGW want you to use slashes (as in
# "C:/src/libpqxx").
#
# Note: Path names may contain spaces eg: C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\11
# However they may not contain the quote " character or escaped characters.
# Do not wrap path names in quotes.

# PGSQLSRC tells us the directory under which all PostgreSQL include
# directories, DLLs and LIB files can be found.
#
# Edit this to suit your installation.

PGSQLSRC=C:\Sources\postgresql-9.1.1\src


# Directory where the Postgres header files, e.g. postgres_ext.h, are found.
#
# You shouldn't normally need to edit this; the default is to take them from
# the PGSQLSRC directory.

PGSQLINC=$(PGSQLSRC)\include

# Directory where the libpq header files, e.g. libpq-fe.h, are found.  If you
# used the One Click Installer, comment out the next line and uncomment the
# one following it:

LIBPQINC=$(PGSQLSRC)\interfaces\libpq

#LIBPQINC=$(PGSQLSRC)\include


# Directory where the release build of the libpq DLL and its corresponding LIB
# file are found, as well as the names of those two files.
#
# If you installed PostgreSQL using the One Click Installer from EnterpriseDB,
# comment out the next three lines and uncomment the following three.
#
# If you are using MinGW, remove the "Release" part from LIBPQPATH.

LIBPQPATH=$(PGSQLSRC)\interfaces\libpq\Release
LIBPQDLL=libpq.dll
LIBPQLIB=libpqdll.lib

#LIBPQPATH=$(PGSQLSRC)\lib
#LIBPQDLL=libpq.dll
#LIBPQLIB=libpq.lib


# Directory where the debug build of the libpq DLL and its corresponding LIB
#  file are found, as well as the names of those two files.
#
# If you don't have access to a debug build of libpq, just provide the same
# information as above here. The debug builds of libpqxx will reference the
# release version of libpq, which will limit your ability to debug libpq
# sources but otherwise should work just fine.
#
# If you installed PostgreSQL using the One Click Installer from EnterpriseDB,
# comment out the next three lines and uncomment the following three.

LIBPQDPATH=$(PGSQLSRC)\interfaces\libpq\Debug
LIBPQDDLL=libpqd.dll
LIBPQDLIB=libpqddll.lib

#LIBPQDPATH=$(PGSQLSRC)\lib
#LIBPQDDLL=libpq.dll
#LIBPQDLIB=libpq.lib
