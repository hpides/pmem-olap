This project hosts operations research tools developed at Google and
made available as open source under the Apache 2.0 License.

The project contains several tools:

- A Constraint Programming solver

- A wrapper around third-party linear solvers:

  - GLPK, CLP, CBC, SCIP, Sulum, and Gurobi

- Knapsack algorithms

- Graph algorithms:

  - min-cost flow

  - max flow

  - linear sum assignment
