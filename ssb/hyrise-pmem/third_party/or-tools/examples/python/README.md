# Python examples
The following examples showcase how to use OrTools.
These examples should work for both Python2.7+ and Python3.5+.

We recommend that all projects you create target `Python 3.7`,
as this allows you to keep up-to-date with the latest Python frameworks.

Wherever you have `ortools` package installed, be sure to import it from your python file.

# Execution
For running the examples you can use the the following command:
```shell
python -m pip install --upgrade --user ortools
python <example>.py
```
