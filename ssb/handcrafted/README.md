# Benchmarking Source Code

This directory contains the source code for the performed SSB benchmarks.

## Building


```sh
make
```

This will give you three `ssb_pmem`, `ssb_dram` and `ssb_ssd` binaries which then can be used in the benchmarking scripts.

## Usage

Please see the `scripts/ssb` directory for example usage.
